FullStack Matching Software for CIC

Current considerations:
  1. Technical Algorithm to be used by backend -> simple keyword matching sufficent or a learning algorithm (database would need to be provided)
  2. Where will application be stored currently planning to be setup as a one button full stack java application but having it stored in server would be ideal
